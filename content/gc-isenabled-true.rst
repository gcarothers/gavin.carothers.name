Well, maybe the 7th try is the charm. This will be at least my 7th blog
like entity. Perhaps this time it will go better. Other blogging
attempts have been, “The Flickering Fluorescent”, DNS lapsed.
`LiveJournal <http://gjc314159.livejournal.com/>`__, which has been
updated a grand total of 3 times… in 7 years. I’m sure there were other
ones, I remember creating the themes and setting them up, don’t remember
much else about them. `Twitter <http://twitter.com/gcarothers>`__ has
been going better, but then it’s not really a blog.

My goal, I think within reason, is to post here at least once a week. Of
course just at the moment this blog doesn’t seem to be off to an
auspicious start.

Ah well, have to start some where.
