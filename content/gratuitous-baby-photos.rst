Since I finally managed to get the blog started a few things have
happened. The most important being that back on January 20th I became a
father! My wife points out that it is now April and that I said before
that I would post once a week at least. Right, didn’t do that. But still
doing better then my LJ account, 3 posts in 5 years. I may not be cut
out for the blogging thing. Anyway, baby pictures!

My wife, a `much better blogger <http://avidinkling.com/>`__ tells me I
should link to the `photo album
here <http://picasaweb.google.com/kindli/OliverAlbum3>`__. I think I’m
getting the hang of this. I’m really much better writing blogging
software, she’s really much better at using it.
